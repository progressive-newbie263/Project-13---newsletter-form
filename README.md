# Project-13---newsletter-form
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv/hub

this is my 13th challenge in frontend mentor. Man, this one really pushed me to my limits. I was stuck for few 
hours doing a very bad call, that is doing wrong format of HTML code therefore my JS code after clicking submit
button only shows success form for a blink of an eyes. 

after that, i still got stucked by too many things. Media queries, after challenge 12, i got an insight look of
it, but it was still challenging. So i decided to switch things up and made the default code becomes one of the
small media query, and the code that is displayed in mobile device became the main code in CSS.

Last but not least, javascript code. Oh man, this one really drove me insane. I did most of the thing successfully,
but there is one thing i couldn't and ended up searching for its code , that is the regex part. Originally, i tried to 
create an array inside a function, but it didn't end up well.

Overall, i am glad that i was able to complete it. It wasn't ideal, it wasn't easy, but it is done.
